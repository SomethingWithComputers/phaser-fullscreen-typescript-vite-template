# Phaser Fullscreen Typescript Vite Template
Really rolls of the tongue doesn't it?

This should get you started with a fullscreen Phaser game.
It features:

- Full Vite development support for really fast recompilation and running;
- Full Typescript support;
- A working fullscreen template that fills the entire window perfectly;
- Boilerplate support for resizing the window;
- Reading of the `.env` file and an example on how to do it.

## Installation
To get started, simply execute:

```
npm install
```

And to use the `.env` file, simply rename `.env.example` to `.env`. On Mac you might have to do it via a terminal. From within the directory execute:
```
mv .env.example .env
```

## Getting started
For development, execute:
```
npm run develop
```
or if you want to access it from elsewhere within your network:

```
npm run develop-hosted
```

If you've finished your amazing game and you'd like to make an optimized build:
```
npm run build
```

The optimized build will appear in the `build` directory.
